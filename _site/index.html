    <h1>Sage</h1>
    <main>
        <p>Burning sage, or <em>smudging</em>, is an ancient ritual deeply rooted in the spiritual practices of Indigenous peoples, particularly in the Americas. Traditionally, it involves burning bundles of dried sage leaves, such as white sage (<em>Salvia apiana</em>), to cleanse spaces, objects, and individuals of negative energy while inviting positivity and spiritual balance. This sacred ceremony often accompanies healing rituals, prayers, and important gatherings, with great respect for its cultural and spiritual significance. During the process, the aromatic smoke is directed toward the areas needing purification, often alongside prayers or intentions.</p>

<p>In modern times, sage burning has gained popularity as a tool for stress relief, mindfulness, and creating a calming atmosphere. However, this widespread use raises concerns about cultural appropriation when the practice is removed from its traditional context. Ethical considerations also include the overharvesting of white sage, which threatens its natural availability. While burning sage can offer benefits like energy cleansing, spiritual grounding, and aromatherapy, it is crucial to approach the practice with respect for its origins, cultural significance, and the sustainable sourcing of materials.</p>
