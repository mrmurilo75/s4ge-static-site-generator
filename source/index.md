1. **[As a Person (Wise Individual)](sage-types/person.md)**
2. **[As a Plant (Culinary and Medicinal)](sage-types/plant.md)**
3. **[In Spiritual and Symbolic Practices](sage-types/spiritual.md)**
4. **[In Literature and Popular Culture](sage-types/literature.md)**
5. **[In Technology](https://mrmurilo75.github.io/s4ge-static-site-generator/)**
