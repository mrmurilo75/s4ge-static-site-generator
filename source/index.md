The word "sage" can refer to several distinct but related concepts, depending on the context. Hereâ€™s an overview:

1. **[As a Person (Wise Individual)](sage-types/person.html)**
2. **[As a Plant (Culinary and Medicinal)](sage-types/plant.html)**
3. **[In Spiritual and Symbolic Practices](sage-types/spiritual.html)**
4. **[In Literature and Popular Culture](sage-types/literature.html)**
5. **[In Technology](https://github.com/mrmurilo75/s4ge-static-site-generator/)**
