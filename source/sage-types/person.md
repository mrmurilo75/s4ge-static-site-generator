---

A sage is traditionally regarded as a person of profound wisdom and knowledge, often sought for their advice or guidance. Sages are typically associated with deep thought, life experience, and an ability to see beyond surface-level matters. They have been celebrated across cultures:

- **In Ancient Greece**: Philosophers like Socrates and Plato were considered sages for their profound insights into human nature and existence.
- **In Eastern Traditions**: Figures like Confucius in China and the rishis in India are revered as sages for their philosophical and spiritual teachings.
- **In Modern Times**: The term can be applied more loosely to someone regarded as an authority in a specific field or as a wise mentor.
