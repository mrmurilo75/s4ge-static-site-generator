Sage holds significant meaning in many spiritual and cultural traditions:
- **Smudging**: White sage (*Salvia apiana*) is used in smudging rituals, particularly among Indigenous peoples of North America. Burning sage is believed to cleanse spaces of negative energy, promote healing, and invite positive vibes.
- **Symbolism**: Sage is often seen as a symbol of wisdom, purification, and longevity.
